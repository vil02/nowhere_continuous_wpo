[This note](./generated/nowhere_continuous_wpo.pdf) contains an example of nowhere continuous (weakly) Picard operator and a motivation to consider such a function.
It was presented during the following talks:
* _O pewnym uogólnieniu równania Steinhausa_ (in Polish) [_About some generalization of Steinhaus functional equation_] ([meeting no. 1291 of the chair of functional equations](http://www.math.us.edu.pl/seminariaRF/archiwum_rf/zrf1213.html), Katowice, 08.01.2013),
* _Some remarks on weakly Picard operators and their application in functional equations_ (9th international Students' Conference on analysis, Ustroń, 03.02.2013).
